# ESP-IDF Project Collection

This repository contains a collection of ESP-IDF projects demonstrating the use of the ESP32 microcontroller. 
Each sub-project is a self-contained example that can be built and flashed independently.

## Project List

* **wifi_sta**: how to connect to a wifi network (sta mode).
* **http**: how to start up a basic http server.
* **mqtt**: how to set up a mqtt broker.
* **config**: how to read the microcontroller data.
* **pin_io**: collection of projects implementing io pins.
    * **button_led**: basic GPIO control with a button and an LED.
    * **gyro-accel**: how to read data from a gyroscope and accelerometer sensor.
    * **motor**: how to control a DC motor.
    * **motor-encoder**: expands on the motor example by adding an encoder for position feedback.
    * **ultrasonic**: implements a distance sensor using an ultrasonic module.

## How to Use
1. Install esp-idf and configure environment variables.
2. Set up project target with `idf.py set-target esp32` and configuration with `idf.py menuconfig`.
5. Build the project by running `idf.py build`. Run `idf.py clean` to clean the previously built artifacts.
6. Connect the microcontroller to the computer via USB and get the port by running `ls /dev/cu.*`.
7. Flash the software into the device by running `idf.py -p PORT flash`. To monitor, keep the microcontroller connected and run `idf.py -p PORT monitor`. To exit monitor use the shortcutÂ `Ctrl+]`.
